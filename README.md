# Utility Functions

This repository was created to imitate the [lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash) library for practicing and fine-tuning my knowledge about JavaScript especially in functions.

## Challenges

1. Create a function `addTwo` that accepts one input and adds 2 to it.
2. Create a function `addS` that accepts one input and adds an "s" to it.
3. Create the function `map`.
4. Create the function `forEach`.
5. Create the function `mapWith` that is the same as `map`, but this time use the `forEach` method inside of the `mapWith` function.
6. Create the function `reduce`.
7. Create the function `intersection`.
8. Create the function `union` that takes in an array of arrays, compares the inner arrays, and returns a new array that contains all elements. If there are duplicate elements, only add it once to the new array. Preserve the order of the elements starting from the first element of the first array.

## Notes

- The challenges are taken from Will Sentance's [course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts-v2/) on FrontendMasters.
